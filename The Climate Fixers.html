<h1>Global Warming/Climate change</h1>
<img src="Global.jpg"height="300"/>
<p>Global Warming/Climate change refers to long-term shifts in tempreratures and weather patterns.these shifts may be natural but sice the 1800s,human activities have been the main driver of Global warming/climate change,primarily due to the buring of fossil fuels such as,coal,oil and gas which produces heat trapping geases.Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the term "climate change."

<h1>Global warming is caused by</h1>

<p>*Generating power:Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still produced from fossil fuels; only about a quarter comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources.</p>
<p>*Manufacturing goods:Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases.</p>
<p>*Cutting down forests:Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits natureâ€™s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.</p>
